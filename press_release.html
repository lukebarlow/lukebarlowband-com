				<HR style="COLOR: black" align="left" width="95%" SIZE="3">
			<P><IMG alt="" src="luke_barlow_band.jpg" align="left" style="MARGIN-RIGHT:10pt">The 
				Luke Barlow band brings together four of London’s most talented young jazz 
				musicians. With influences ranging between Bach, Bailey, Stravinsky, Zorn, 
				Goldie, Monk and Melt Banana, Luke’s compositions lure the listener with catchy 
				melodies before deftly leading them through experiments with jazz compositional 
				structure, unsuspectingly transiting from detailed composition into free 
				improvisation, and exposing them to dense counterpoint, swift groove changes, 
				energetic instrumental workouts, and expansive group improvisation along the 
				way. The band has recently released their debut album, which can be bought at 
				the record company’s website <EM>www.copepod.co.uk</EM>. The members of the 
				Luke Barlow Band are all strong distinctive players, and all bandleaders in 
				their own right.

			<P><STRONG>Luke Barlow (piano, composition)</STRONG> has been playing piano and 
				saxophone in jazz and rock bands since he was a teenager. From 1997 until 2001, 
				he played keyboards in the rock band Camp Blackfoot. He is now a member of the 
				highly acclaimed Nøught (championed by the late John Peel) and also plays in 
				many other groups, as well as leading The Luke Barlow Band. He has studied at 
				the Guildhall School of Music and Drama, and has a number of ‘classical’ 
				compositions to his name, most of them fiendishly difficult. He also plays 
				frequently around Europe with the dance group the Sign Dance Collective, 
				recently appearing at Festival Lent in Maribor, Slovenia, and live in Trafalgar 
				Square in a stripped down alto and drums duo.</P>
			<P><STRONG>Alex Ward (clarinet)</STRONG> was born in 1974 and has been playing 
				improvised music in public since 1986, mainly as a clarinettist but also on 
				alto sax, piano and (with increasing frequency) guitar. Over this time he has 
				worked with Derek Bailey, Eugene Chadbourne, Simon Fell, Steve Noble, Pat 
				Thomas, Steve Beresford, Ingar Zach and Butch Morris, amongst many others. He 
				has also played in a number of rock bands, notably Camp Blackfoot and John 
				Bisset’s Pocket. As well as leading his own improvising group, feauting Luke 
				and the world class rhythm section of Simon Fell and Steve Noble, his current 
				projects include a recently released album of songs, ‘Hapless Days’, and 
				performances in this vein both solo and with his band The Dead Ends.
			</P>
			<P><STRONG>Santiago Horro (double bass)</STRONG> was brought up on a diet of AC/DC 
				and Motorhead before turning to blues, then jazz such as Ornette Coleman and 
				Cecil Taylor and back to likes of the Chilli Peppers and the Minutemen. Now, as 
				a performer of all these types of music, and equally comfortable on electric 
				and upright bass, Sant plays extensively around London with a number of bands. 
				He plays in Nøught, and leads his own vocal funk / rock /soul band Los 
				Huevones.</P>
			<P><STRONG>Mark Holub (drums)</STRONG> brings enormous vitality to the band with 
				his energetic and inventive drumming. Mark is currently making waves on the 
				jazz scene with his own highly acclaimed band, <EM>Led Bib</EM>. Mark started 
				drumming in New York and brings much of that downtown flavour to London. He has 
				recently graduated from Middlesex University in the jazz MA course.
